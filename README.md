 # Ace Programming Language #
 
 Ace is a dynamic programming language created in C++. 
 It features optional typing and is inspired by languages such as C++, JavaScript, Rust and Ruby.
 
 ## Building ##
 
 Ace is set up with CMake, so you can just go into the 'build' directory and run the command `cmake ../src` to generate makefiles or project files.
 Once that's done, type `make` if you are using Makefiles, or just open the project files in your IDE if that's what you generated.
 
 ## Running ##
 
 Once you're done compiling Ace and it's different components, an executable simple called 'ace' should be created.
 If you run that in a terminal you will be able to type lines of code and have them evaluates as you go.
 You can also run ace with command line arguments to run a file or decompile Ace bytecode.
 
 To run from file, simply use this command: `ace filename.ace` where 'filename.ace' is your actual filename.
 This will generate a file containing executable bytecode named `filename.aex`. It will also run that executable file, showing you the output.
 
 To decompile the generated bytecode file, use this syntax: `ace -d filename.aex` where 'filename.aex' is the name of the generated bytecode file.
 This command will show you the bytecode instructions the Ace compiler generated which the Ace VM has then executed.
 
 ## Examples ##
 
 #### Modules ####
 
 Currently, all Ace code files must start with a `module` declaration, with the name of the module following.
 Example:
 
 ```
 module ace_example
 ```
 
 This `module` declaration will allow you to use your code from other files, using the syntax: `ace_example::some_global_variable`.
 
 #### Hello World ####
 
 Now that we've created our module 'ace_example', let's make it print something to the screen.
 We can print something using the `print` statement, like this:
 
 ```
 print 'Hello, world!'
 ```
 
 Notice that we placed `'Hello, world!'` in single quotes. 
 In Ace, strings can be typed with either single quotes or double quotes.
 
 The print statement can also take multiple arguments, using commas:
 
 ```
 print 'Hello ', 'World'
 ```
